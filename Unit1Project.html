in football have become an epidemic in the football community and has
become a popular subject to talk about amongst the media, football
fans, players, coaches, and parents of America. Recently the National
Football League (NFL) has been under a lot of scrutiny for not
protecting their players properly and not letting them know about
concussions sooner. Many former players who played in the NFL have
had many problems mentally ever since they have retired from NFL,
such as former NFL player Junior Seau who committed suicide on May 2,
2012. In an autopsy, it was later revealed that Seau was suffering
from Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) which is a disease that
develops in the brain due to many concussions sustained over time
from constant blows to the head. Now the players (current and former)
are feeling like the NFL has known about the dangers of concussions
for a long time and have failed to notify, educate, and protect their
players.</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A
concussion is when the brain receives impact from a force or hit; you
could get a concussion from many different aspects of life, but
football has been considered a huge sport where concussions occur
frequently. Concussions cannot be proven through a MRI or X-Ray. But
concussions come with many symptoms that could come within minutes of
sustaining one, or hours after. There are many symptoms which
include: &ldquo;Dizziness, Balance problems, Headache, being
sensitive to light or noise&rdquo; </font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span lang="en-GB">(BIANJ
2015</span></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">).
Due to sustaining multiple concussions overtime, players can
typically develop many brain diseases such as CTE in their 40&rsquo;s
and beyond. So now the NFL has been sued by a lot of their former
players because the players claim that the NFL knew of the dangers of
concussions long ago and are just now addressing concussions or
trying to prevent them. </font></font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">
 <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Now
that addressing concussions is in the limelight, there are many
things you can do to help lower the risk of concussions. But there
still will always be a chance of you sustaining a concussion when
playing football. If you are having concussion-like symptoms or think
you may have a concussion, you should: &ldquo;Go to the doctor, get
physical rest, take cognitive tests, and also keep a calendar of
symptoms and report them to your doctor at follow-up visits&rdquo;
(BIANJ 2015). Even though there is no form or type of equipment that
can stop you from sustaining a concussion, there are many things you
can do and wear to prevent concussions or at least, lessen your
chance of sustaining them. A big way you can keep your brain safe is
to keep your head up while performing a tackle or block on another
player. A lot of players now-a-days lead with the crown of their
helmet and some end up getting a concussion as a result of them
lowering their head. Some like former Rutgers linebacker Eric
LeGrand, have experience far worse consequences for tackling with the
crown of their helmet. LeGrand had sustained an injury to his spinal
cord from the tackle and had become paralyzed from the waste down. 
So tackling technique is a huge way to prevent concussions and
further injury. Equipment can play a big role in concussions as well.
Many helmet companies such as Riddell and Schutt have been working
year-to-year by trying to create a newer, safer helmet. By wearing
the newest helmets issued, you can help protect your head and brain a
lot more. </font></font>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Concussions
are a dangerous injury and can do more damage to your body long-term
than any other injury. Pulled muscles, fractured arms, broken
collarbones and plenty of other injuries can heal. But concussions
that are not treated can hurt your brain mentally over a long period
of time and definitely in your life once football is over. There are
many helmets that are made that can promise you that they are safer
than other helmets, but right now there is no such helmet that can
keep anyone from having a 0% chance of sustaining a concussion. When
you play the game of football there is not much you can do to save
yourself from being 100% safe from concussions, but you can do a lot
of things right and wear the correct and safest equipment to better
your chances. The only thing anyone can do to stop them from
sustaining a concussion from playing football is to not play football
at all. When someone signs up to play football, injuries and
concussions are a big thing that comes as a risk when you play this
sport.</font></font></p>
